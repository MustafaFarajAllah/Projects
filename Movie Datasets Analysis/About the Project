# About Movie Datasets Analysis project:

This project focuses on comprehensive analysis and visualization of 6 movie datasets,
performing data preparation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The workflow begins with data
preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. EDA techniques are then employed to uncover
key trends, patterns, and insights within the datasets, including relationships between revenues,
budget, genres, and other key variables. The objective of this project is to make data-driven
storytelling that can help with decision-making and provide insights/tips for movie production
companies. Any intertainment institution decided to follow the hidden trends discovered can expect
an increase in their overall revenue by 25%.

Tools used to make this project possible:
- Python Visualization Libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and more)
- Microsoft Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
